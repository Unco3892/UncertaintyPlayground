# Uncertainty Playground: Fast estimation of prediction intervals with neural networks

This Python library provides fast ( and *easy*) uncertainty estimation for regression tasks built on top of `PyTorch` & `GPyTorch.` Specifically, the library uses `Sparse & Variational Gaussian Process Regression` for Gaussian cases (normally distributed outcomes) and `Mixed Density Networks` for multi-modal cases. Users can estimate the prediction interval for a given instance with either model. The library was developed and maintained by [Ilia Azizi](https://iliaazizi.com/). Please note that this version is still in early development and not ready for production use.
